Recommendations:

Focus on Diesel Vehicles:

Given their dominance in pricing and market share, dealerships should prioritize stocking diesel-powered vehicles while continuing to explore opportunities for petrol models.

Expand Premium Model Inventory:

High-value models like Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Audi are leading the market. Adding more premium brand vehicles could attract customers willing to invest in luxury options.

Address Limited Fuel Type Diversity:

With no recorded sales for CNG, Electric, and LPG cars, dealerships should investigate market demand for alternative fuel vehicles and promote their benefits to diversify offerings.

Highlight Automatic Transmissions:

Automatic cars are associated with higher price brackets, indicating a preference among buyers. Promotions and marketing campaigns for automatic transmission models could drive sales.

Utilize Mileage Data for Sales Strategies:

Models with high cumulative kilometers driven demonstrate reliability. Dealers can use this data to highlight these vehicles' performance and durability in their marketing.

Promote Mid-Sized Engine Vehicles:

Engines between 1968 CC and 2143 CC represent a balance between performance and affordability. Focus on these segments to cater to broader customer preferences.

Encourage Luxury Buyers:

Since luxury models dominate the price spectrum, targeting affluent customers through exclusive events, financing options, and loyalty programs could enhance sales.

Conclusion:

The 2019 analysis reveals key insights into customer preferences and vehicle trends, with diesel cars, automatic transmissions, and premium models leading the market. Strategic alignment with these trends can help dealerships maximize sales and meet consumer demands effectively.
